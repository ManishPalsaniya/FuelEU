## Core Features:

- Route Data Fetching: Fetch all route data with filters for vessel type, fuel type, and year.
- Baseline Setting: Set a specific route as the baseline for GHG emissions.
- GHG Comparison: Compare route GHG intensity against the set baseline, calculate percentage difference, and determine compliance.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep navy blue (#1A237E) to evoke a sense of maritime authority and compliance.
- Background color: Light gray (#E8EAF6), a desaturated version of the primary color to create a comfortable dark theme background.
- Accent color: Teal (#26A69A) as an analogous hue to the primary, but higher in saturation and brightness for highlighting key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font that brings a modern, machined and neutral look, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use sharp, vectorized icons for dashboard elements, representing vessel types, fuel indicators, and compliance metrics.
- Implement a responsive grid layout to accommodate data tables, charts, and interactive components across various screen sizes.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on interactions and state changes, enhancing user experience.
